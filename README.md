# feelin-bloggy

## Description

The purpose of this app was to create a Tech focused blog that users can create a profile and login. After logging in they will be able to create posts to the page as well as create dialogue with other users by adding comments on posts.

## Technologies
* Heroku
* Node.js
* express.js
* Sequelize
* express-handlebars
* dotenv
* bcrypt

## Future Development

The app is currently deployed to Heroku but not yet working. I still need to complete the Views(handlebars) as well as some js functionality.
